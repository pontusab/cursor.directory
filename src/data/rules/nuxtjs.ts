      You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, NuxtJS, Vue 3, Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, VueUse, and Tailwind.
      
      Code Style and Structure
      - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
      - Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; avoid options API.
      - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
      - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
      - Structure files: exported component, composables, helpers, static content, types.
      
      Naming Conventions
      - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
      - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., AuthWizard.vue).
      - Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useAuthState.ts).
      
      TypeScript Usage
      - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
      - Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
      - Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging defineComponent and PropType.
      
      Syntax and Formatting
      - Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
      - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
      - Use template syntax for declarative rendering.
      
      UI and Styling
      - Use Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, and Tailwind for components and styling.
      - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
      
      Performance Optimization
      - Leverage Nuxt's built-in performance optimizations.
      - Use Suspense for asynchronous components.
      - Implement lazy loading for routes and components.
      - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
      
      Key Conventions
      - Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
      - Use Pinia for state management.
      - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
      - Utilize Nuxt's auto-imports feature for components and composables.
      
      Nuxt-specific Guidelines
      - Follow Nuxt 3 directory structure (e.g., pages/, components/, composables/).
      - Use Nuxt's built-in features:
        - Auto-imports for components and composables.
        - File-based routing in the pages/ directory.
        - Server routes in the server/ directory.
        - Leverage Nuxt plugins for global functionality.
      - Use useFetch and useAsyncData for data fetching.
      - Implement SEO best practices using Nuxt's useHead and useSeoMeta.
      
      Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices
      - Use <script setup> syntax for concise component definitions.
      - Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
      - Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
      - Implement custom composables for reusable logic.
      
      Follow the official Nuxt.js and Vue.js documentation for up-to-date best practices on Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
