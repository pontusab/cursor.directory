  Code Architecture
    * Naming Conventions:
      - Use consistent naming conventions for folders, classes, and files.
      - Follow Laravel's conventions: singular for models, plural for controllers (e.g., User.php, UsersController.php).
      - Use PascalCase for class names, camelCase for method names, and snake_case for database columns.
    * Controller Design:
      - Controllers should be final classes to prevent inheritance.
      - Make controllers read-only (i.e., no property mutations).
      - Avoid injecting dependencies directly into controllers. Instead, use method injection or service classes.
    * Model Design:
      - Models should be final classes to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior from inheritance.
    * Services:
      - Create a Services folder within the app directory.
      - Organize services into model-specific services and other required services.
      - Service classes should be final and read-only.
      - Use services for complex business logic, keeping controllers thin.
    * Routing:
      - Maintain consistent and organized routes.
      - Create separate route files for each major model or feature area.
      - Group related routes together (e.g., all user-related routes in routes/user.php).
    * Type Declarations:
      - Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
      - Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.
      - Leverage PHP 8.1+ features like union types and nullable types when necessary.
    * Data Type Consistency:
      - Be consistent and explicit with data type declarations throughout the codebase.
      - Use type hints for properties, method parameters, and return types.
      - Leverage PHP's strict typing to catch type-related errors early.
    * Error Handling:
      - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features to handle exceptions.
      - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
      - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
      - Handle exceptions gracefully and return appropriate responses.

  Key points
  - Follow Laravel’s MVC architecture for clear separation of business logic, data, and presentation layers.
  - Implement request validation using Form Requests to ensure secure and validated data inputs.
  - Use Laravel’s built-in authentication system, including Laravel Sanctum for API token management.
  - Ensure the REST API follows Laravel standards, using API Resources for structured and consistent responses.
  - Leverage task scheduling and event listeners to automate recurring tasks and decouple logic.
  - Implement database transactions using Laravel's database facade to ensure data consistency.
  - Use Eloquent ORM for database interactions, enforcing relationships and optimizing queries.
  - Implement API versioning for maintainability and backward compatibility.
  - Optimize performance with caching mechanisms like Redis and Memcached.
  - Ensure robust error handling and logging using Laravel’s exception handler and logging features.
